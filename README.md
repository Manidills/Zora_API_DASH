## Problems

* Based on my research ZORA Protocols lacks on analytics dashborads with proper maintenance.
* No simple user interface and data download option for ZORA API (https://playground.api.zora.co/), people need to write code to download there require nft data and need to spend some time on graphql if they not familiar.
* Finding the trending and rare ZORA NFT collection's are difficult
* People are more interested to listen audio book rather the reading now a days but finding difficulties on converting there documents || Ebooks into audio format and mint as a nft.

## Solution
```sh
ZORA API DASH

1. It support basic analytics charts for zora marketplaces, zora auction house, zora creator and zora api genesis hackathon.

2. It provide simple user interface for ALL ZORA ENDPOINTS with data download option(CSV format) for further analysis. People dont need to code or understanding about graphql to get these data.

3. Nft tracker option to check rarity and fast selling || most demanded NFTS based on collections.

4. Easy user interface to convert pdf to audio and one click to mint as a NFT TOKEN with the help of ZORA, POLYGON and NFT STORGAE.
